        # 1. Save your kubeconfig file as a GitHub secret (e.g., KUBE_CONFIG).

        #    - name: Configure kubectl
        #      run: |
        #        mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
        #        echo "${{ secrets.KUBE_CONFIG }}" | base64 -d > $HOME/.kube/config
        # 3. Then, the kubectl commands below would work.
        
        # The actual deployment commands for a real cluster:
        # kubectl apply -f k8s/
        # kubectl set image deployment/my-app-deployment my-app-container=${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/my-cicd-app:${{ github.sha }}
